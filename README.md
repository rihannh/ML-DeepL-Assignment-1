# IMDB Sentiment Classification with BiLSTM (a type of RNN)

## üìå What are we making?
This project is a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. The goal is to build a deep learning model using BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) to capture context from both directions in a sentence, improving classification performance.

<br>

## üèóÔ∏è What architecture do we use?

The model uses a **Sequential architecture** consisting of:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Layer**: Learns context from both directions in the text.
- **Dropout Layers**: Helps prevent overfitting.
- **Dense Layer (ReLU)**: Learns complex patterns.
- **Dense Output Layer (Sigmoid)**: Outputs binary prediction (positive/negative).

<br>

## üß∞ What libraries do we use?

The following libraries were used in this project:

- `tensorflow` / `keras` ‚Äì deep learning framework
- `tensorflow_datasets` ‚Äì to load IMDB dataset
- `nltk` ‚Äì for tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization, and POS tagging
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äì for evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, classification report)
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` ‚Äì for plotting training metrics and confusion matrix
- `tqdm` ‚Äì for displaying progress bars

## üöÄ How to run our model

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rihannh/ML-DeepL-Assignment-1.git
```

### 2. Open the notebook:
- File name: Main.ipynb
- Run it using Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Kaggle Notebook.

### 3. Run all cells from top to bottom.
The notebook includes:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization, tokenization)
- Model building and training
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
- Visualization of loss and accuracy

### 4. Or load our trained model
```bash
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('Result Model/Model.keras')
```
